She lived there with her mother, sister Cassandra and family friend Martha Lloyd. During the time she spent in the cottage, she wrote Emma, Persuasion and Mansfield Park.
        The building was originally built as a farmhouse, and was later used as an inn. In 1769, the house was bought by Austen's distant relatives, the Knight family, who made the house part of the estate in Chawton. Later they named Edward, Jane's older brother, as heir. In 1809, Edward invited his mother and sisters to move to a small house in Chawton. Jane Austen died on July 18, 1817 in Winchester, where she had been receiving medical treatment for the last 2 months. Mrs. Austen and Cassandra continued to live there until their death. In 1845, after Cassandra's death, the house was returned to the estate in Chawton and divided into three dwellings for the staff of the estate, and served as an office and a club for workers.
        Carpenter established the Jane Austen Memorial Foundation to establish the museum. On July 23, 1949, the Jane Austen Museum was opened. Initially, most of the house was occupied by renters, only one room was open to the public. Later, with the departure of the renters, other rooms became available to visitors.">

At the end of the 16th century, Otto and Catherine Gilbert built a mansion called Greenway Court. In 1700, the Gilberts sold the Greenway to Thomas Martin, making nearby Compton Castle their residence. After a chain of handovers of the estate, it finally came into the posession of Rupa Harris. He built a Georgian-style house, and in 1791 sold it to Edward Elton. In 1800, Rupe went bankrupt, probably because of the funds spent on the restoration of the Greenway. 
  Agatha Christie and her husband Max Mallowan left their home in Torquay, because new buildings blocked the view of the sea. Christie noticed Greenway from her youth, considering it the perfect possession on the Dart. Noticing that it was free, she hurried to go there. 
  The couple lived there until their death (Christie in 1976, Mallowan in 1978). Christie made references to the estate in several of her works.">

The sisters got into the habit of gathering around the table and discussing their ideas and projects before going to bed. The death of the sisters did not stop Charlotte from walking around the room - she could not fall asleep without this ritual. 
  There is no more suitable place for a maid's chilling stories than the kitchen fireplace – it was where the sisters entertained themselves as children with stories about the Yorkshire moors. 
After the death of Elizabeth Branwell, the sisters' aunt, Emily took care of the house. She helped in the kitchen, baked bread. 
   Tabby Aykroyd, the maid who told dark stories by the fireplace, managed to become a close friend of the family during the 30 years she spent in the house, and, probably, an especially important figure for those who grew up without a mother.
